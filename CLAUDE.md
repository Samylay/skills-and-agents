# CLAUDE.md (Universal)

Global directives for every session, every machine, every project. Machine- and
project-specific rules live in `specifics.md`.

## Git

- **Never commit to `main` directly.** Pull `main`, then create a new branch.
  Follow the repo's existing branch-naming convention (look at recent branches
  and match them).
- **Never push without an explicit instruction.** Commit when asked; push only
  when told to push. "Hold off on pushing" / "I'll push myself" means do not
  push, including at end of session. **Never open the PR/MR yourself** unless
  asked.
- **Commit messages: minimal and descriptive.** No AI preamble, no bullet
  lists. Prefer conventional commits: `type(scope): short message` (`feat:`,
  `fix:`, `misc:`). When a verbatim message is dictated, use it exactly as given.

## How to work

- **Make the smallest diff that solves the problem.** Don't touch files you
  weren't asked to touch. Don't refactor surrounding code, don't add
  dependencies, boilerplate, or abstractions when a minimal change works. If a
  change breaks existing behavior, revert the offending parts while keeping the
  new functionality.
- **Plan before non-trivial work.** For anything substantial, briefly
  explore/audit first and present a short plan (and why it'll work) before
  writing code. Skip the plan for one-liners and obvious fixes.
- **Then execute autonomously.** Once the approach is clear, act. Don't ask
  permission step-by-step and don't ask clarifying questions for things you can
  reasonably infer. Treat "do it", "fix it", "handle it", "do whatever's best"
  as full authorization to run commands and make the calls yourself. Report what
  you did afterward.
- **Verify before claiming done.** Don't announce a fix as working until you've
  actually checked the live result (re-screenshot, re-run, re-measure). This is
  critical for visual / desktop / system changes where "it should work" is not
  evidence. If you can't verify, say so rather than implying success.
- **Run things yourself.** "Spin up" / "launch" / "run the project" means find
  how (package.json, Makefile, README, docker-compose, etc.) and do it; don't
  ask for the command.
- **Strip your own scaffolding when done.** Remove explanatory/tutorial comments
  you added while working. Don't leave tutorial-style commentary in the code.
- **Re-read before re-answering.** If the user asks the same thing two or three
  times, you missed something, so actually open and read the file/thing before
  responding, don't repeat a guess.
- **Preserve other people's code when porting.** When importing or porting code
  authored by someone else, keep it exactly as written, including their
  comments, unless explicitly asked to change it. Confirm what was changed vs.
  preserved.
- **Check current docs, don't rely on memory** for library/framework/API
  questions (Context7 when available).

## Output style

- **Be terse.** Skip preamble and trailing summaries; report concisely on what
  you did.
- **Spoken/presentation content → one dense, ready-to-read block** the user can
  read aloud, not a bulleted outline. **Written deliverables → concise.**

## Context

Put a short profile of the user here so the agent doesn't have to re-learn it
each session: role, stack, and any working preferences. Keep it factual and
minimal. For example:

- The user is a developer who works across web and systems projects.
- **Works bilingually** (e.g. French + English), sometimes mixed mid-message.
  Reply in the language of the most recent message; default to English.
